                    <p>Our meeting with Senator Billig's assistant was extremely successful. Since they are located in Spokane, they were not previously exposed to FIRST before. After we introduced the program, showed our robot, and explained a match to show the collaboration and teamwork within alliances, the legislative assistant seemed super willing to bring this up with Senator Billig to see how best to provide more funding for teams and a building in Kent. He was extremely friendly, seemed impressed by our work, asked a lot of questions, and even asked how he could help our mission. This was an extremely successful meeting for WA STEM Advocacy!</p>

                    <h2>Supporting School District Levys</h2>
                    <p style="font-weight: 300; padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;"><b></b>School District levys go towards funding school district technology, higher-level education, and more benefits for the academic success of students. To advocate for better education, specifically in STEM education, WA STEM Advocacy advocated families to vote for the levy in their district to promote funding for after-school activities like FIRST. We were able to post on various social media platforms!</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>We also talked with Melissa deVita, the financial officer of the Bellevue School District, on how we can increase funding for STEM in the Bellevue School District. We were able to learn about how the levy will go towards students pursuing their passion, which very much includes STEM funding.</p>
